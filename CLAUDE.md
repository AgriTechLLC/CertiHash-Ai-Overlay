# CERTIHASH AI-Powered Prometheus Overlay - Development Notes

## Project Overview
This project is an AI-powered Prometheus overlay for CERTIHASH, integrating blockchain technology with metrics monitoring and AI-powered analytics.

## Development Timeline

### Phase 1: Core Implementation
- Created the basic application architecture and microservices
- Set up Docker containerization for all services
- Implemented Prometheus integration and metrics collection
- Added Grafana dashboards for visualization
- Integrated blockchain storage via BSV and Arcivist

### Phase 2: Security Enhancements
- Added JWT authentication with refresh tokens
- Implemented role-based access control (RBAC) system
- Created rate limiting middleware with Redis
- Set up security headers with CSP and other protections
- Added API key authentication
- Configured SSL/TLS with secure settings
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Developed User model with security features
- Created scripts for security configuration

### Phase 3: UI Components
- Built core dashboard components
- Added AI-powered features including:
  - Natural language query interface
  - Anomaly detection
  - Predictive analytics
  - Auto-generated dashboards
- Created security management UI:
  - Security Dashboard
  - Account Security Panel
  - API Management Panel
  - Security Logs Panel

## Notes for Future Development
1. The application uses Anthropic's Claude for AI capabilities, configured in ai-service
2. Security is implemented at multiple layers with comprehensive RBAC
3. All services are containerized and can be deployed with docker-compose
4. Remember to check README.md files in each directory for specific component details
5. GitHub repository: https://github.com/AgriTechLLC/CertiHash-Ai-Overlay.git

## Environment Setup
Environment variables are detailed in .env.example - remember to create a proper .env file before deployment.
